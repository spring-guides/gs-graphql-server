= Building a GraphQL service with Spring for GraphQL

https://docs.spring.io/spring-graphql/docs/current/reference/html/[Spring for GraphQL] provides support for Spring applications built on https://www.graphql-java.com/[GraphQL Java].

This guide walks you through the process of creating a GraphQL service in Java using Spring for GraphQL.

== What You Will Build
You will build a service that will accept GraphQL requests at `http://localhost:8080/graphql`.

== What You Need

:java_version: 17

== Starting with Spring Initializr

To manually initialize the project:

. Navigate to https://start.spring.io.
This service pulls in all the dependencies you need for an application and does most of the setup for you.
. Choose either Gradle or Maven and the language you want to use. This guide assumes that you chose Java.
. Choose Spring Boot 3.x
. Choose at least Java 17 (minimum requirement for Spring Boot 3.x)
. Click *Dependencies* and select *Spring for GraphQL* and *Spring Web*.
. Click *Generate*.
. Download the resulting ZIP file, which is an archive of a GraphQL application that is configured with your choices.

NOTE: If your IDE has the Spring Initializr integration, you can complete this process from your IDE.

NOTE: You can also fork the project from https://github.com/spring-guides/graphql-server[GitHub] and open it in your IDE or other editor.

== A very short introduction to GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language to retrieve data from a server.
It is an alternative to REST, SOAP, or gRPC.

In this tutorial, we will query the details for a specific book from an online store backend.

This is an example request you can send to a  GraphQL server to retrieve book details:

[,graphql]
----
query bookDetails {
  bookById(id: "book-1"){
    id
    name
    pageCount
    author {
      firstName
      lastName
    }
  }
}
----

This GraphQL request says:

* perform a query for a book with id "book-1"
* for the book, return id, name, pageCount and author
* for the author, return firstName and lastName

The response is in JSON. For example:

[,json]
----
{
  "bookById": {
    "id":"book-1",
    "name":"Effective Java",
    "pageCount":416,
    "author": {
      "firstName":"Joshua",
      "lastName":"Bloch"
    }
  }
}
----

An important feature of GraphQL is that it defines a schema language, and that it is statically typed. The server knows exactly what types of objects requests can query and what fields those objects contain. Furthermore, clients can introspect the server to ask for schema details.

NOTE: The word schema in this tutorial refers to a "GraphQL Schema", which is not related to other schemas like "JSON Schema" or "Database Schema".

The schema for the above query is:

[,graphql]
----
type Query {
  bookById(id: ID): Book
}

type Book {
  id: ID
  name: String
  pageCount: Int
  author: Author
}

type Author {
  id: ID
  firstName: String
  lastName: String
}
----

This tutorial will focus on how to implement a GraphQL server with this schema in Java.

We've barely scratched the surface of what's possible with GraphQL.
Further information can be found on the https://graphql.org/learn/[official GraphQL page].

== Our example API: getting book details
These are the main steps to create a server with https://docs.spring.io/spring-graphql/docs/current/reference/html/[Spring for GraphQL]:

. Define a GraphQL schema
. Implement the logic to fetch the actual data for a query

Our example app will be a simple API to get details for a specific book. It is not intended to be a comprehensive API.

== Schema
In your Spring for GraphQL application prepared earlier, create a directory `src/main/resources/graphql`.

Add a new file `schema.graphqls` to `src/main/resources/graphql` with the following content:

[,graphql]
----
type Query {
  bookById(id: ID): Book
}

type Book {
  id: ID
  name: String
  pageCount: Int
  author: Author
}

type Author {
  id: ID
  firstName: String
  lastName: String
}
----

Every GraphQL schema has a top-level `Query` type, and the fields under it are the query operations exposed by the application. Here the schema defines one query called `bookById` that returns the details of a specific book.

It also defines the types `Book` with fields `id`, `name`, `pageCount` and `author`, and the type `Author` with fields `firstName` and `lastName`.

NOTE: The Domain Specific Language used above to describe a schema is called the Schema Definition Language or SDL. For more details, see the https://graphql.org/learn/schema/[GraphQL documentation].

== Source of the data

A key strength of GraphQL is that data can be sourced from anywhere. Data can come from a database, an external service, or a static in-memory list.

To simplify the tutorial, book and author data will come from static lists inside their respective classes.

=== Create the Book class

Add the following to `Book.java`. You choose where to save this file, it can be in the same directory as the class containing the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation.

[,java]
----
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public record Book (String id, String name, int pageCount, String authorId) {

    private static List<Book> books = Arrays.asList(
            new Book("book-1", "Effective Java", 416, "author-1"),
            new Book("book-2", "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", 208, "author-2"),
            new Book("book-3", "Down Under", 436, "author-3")
    );

    public static Book getById(String id) {
        return books.stream().filter(book -> book.id().equals(id)).findFirst().orElse(null);
    }
}
----

=== Create the Author class

Add the following to `Author.java`. Save it in the same directory as `Book.java`.

[,java]
----
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public record Author (String id, String firstName, String lastName) {

    private static List<Author> authors = Arrays.asList(
            new Author("author-1", "Joshua", "Bloch"),
            new Author("author-2", "Douglas", "Adams"),
            new Author("author-3", "Bill", "Bryson")
    );

    public static Author getById(String id) {
        return authors.stream().filter(author -> author.id().equals(id)).findFirst().orElse(null);
    }
}
----

== Adding code to fetch data

Spring for GraphQL provides an https://docs.spring.io/spring-graphql/docs/current/reference/html/#controllers[annotation-based programming model] to declare handler methods to fetch the data for specific GraphQL fields.

Add the following to `BookController.java`. You choose where to save this file, it can be in the same directory as the class containing the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation.

[,java]
----
import org.springframework.graphql.data.method.annotation.Argument;
import org.springframework.graphql.data.method.annotation.QueryMapping;
import org.springframework.graphql.data.method.annotation.SchemaMapping;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;

@Controller
public class BookController {
    @QueryMapping
    public Book bookById(@Argument String id) {
        return Book.getById(id);
    }

    @SchemaMapping
    public Author author(Book book) {
        return Author.getById(book.authorId());
    }
}
----

The `@QueryMapping` annotation binds this method to a query, a field under the Query type.
The query field is then determined from the method name, `bookById`.
The query field could also be declared on the annotation.

NOTE: Spring for GraphQL uses `RuntimeWiring.Builder` that registers each such controller method as a GraphQL Java `graphql.schema.DataFetcher` that provides the logic to fetch the data for a query or for any schema field. The Spring Boot starter for GraphQL has auto-config that automates this registration.

In the GraphQL Java engine, `DataFetchingEnvironment` provides access to a map of field-specific argument values.
Use the `@Argument` annotation to have an argument bound to a target object and injected into the handler method.
By default, the method parameter name is used to look up the argument.
The argument name can be specified in the annotation.

The `@SchemaMapping` annotation maps a handler method to a field in the GraphQL schema and declares it to be the `DataFetcher` for that field.
The field name defaults to the method name, and the type name defaults to the simple class name of the source/parent object injected into the method.
In this example, the field defaults to `author` and the type defaults to `Book`.
The type and field can be specified in the annotation.

That's all the code we need!

Let's run our first query.

== Running our first query

=== Enable the GraphiQL Playground

GraphiQL is a useful visual interface for writing and executing queries, and much more.
Enable GraphiQL by adding this config to the `application.properties` file.

----
spring.graphql.graphiql.enabled=true
----

=== Boot the application

Start your Spring application.

Navigate to http://localhost:8080/graphiql or your custom URL.

=== Run the query

Type in the query and hit the play button at the top of the window.

[,graphql]
----
query bookDetails {
  bookById(id: "book-1") {
    id
    name
    pageCount
    author {
      id
      firstName
      lastName
    }
  }
}
----
